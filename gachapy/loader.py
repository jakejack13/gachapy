"""Collection of loader functions for loading gachapy objects from json files. 
These functions can be used to save and load Controller objects to and from
json files. This should be used to save and load game state of active 
gachapy games.
WARNING: Only use load_controller and save_controller as your top-level loader 
functions. Using the other three helper functions seperately will result in an 
incomplete and uncoupled Controller. Only use if you know what you're doing

These functions operate as the Loader of a gachapy game
